How to complete the quest (probably) if you don't
know anything about it:

1) Find the pirate captain in the cabin of the ship in
   the cave. He'll give a list if things needed to take
   the ship to sea:

   - Pirate flag (from lev1_south_guardroom)
   - 'Magic' powder keg (from lev1_gunpowder_room)
   - Grappling hook (hook from cove_rocks tied to any rope,
                     for example the one in lev1_storeroom)
   - Sextant (from lev2_living_quarters)
   - Cannon ball (from lev3_bowling_hall)
   - Gaff sail (from lev3_storage_room)
   - Looking glass (from harbour_under_water)

2) When all of the above are in the right place in the ship,
   the ship will leave the cave and the players will have to
   perform tasks on orders from the captain:

   a) Raise the gaff sail -> the ship sails away.
   b) Climb into the crows nest with the looking glass and spot
      a ship to rob
   c) Raise the pirate flag
   d) Go below deck and fire the cannon to cripple the spotted
      ship
   e) Use the grappling hook to board the other ship and find
      the treasure chest there. The monsters on the ship will
      be scared wimps so no fighting is involved unless players
      want to beat them up
   f) Go back to the pirate ship and give the treasure to the
      captain

The captain will take the ship back and drop the players off. If
anyone wants to abort the quest before it's done, they can walk
the plank on the deck of the ship and be washed up on the
NewbieIsle shore.

There will be a 20 minute time limit once the ship sails out. If
the players can't get the job done during that time, the captain
will throw them off his ship and let them drift to NewbieIsle
shore and take the ship back. He does this mainly to stop some
idling sod from hijacking the ship, or from locking it up if
everyone onboard when the ship leaves walk the plank.
