There are two specialish items in this are, both under Object/

* magic_powder_barrel.c
  magic_powder.c

 The barrel can be used to pour powder on the ground, and when the powder is
 ignited, there's a big explosion that can blow things and monsters out of
 the room. It can't be used under water, it can't be used in no_fight rooms.
 Unkillable or no_flee monsters are not blown away even if they fail the
 stat check vs con & siz. It gives temporary penalty to players flung out
 of the room, but no hp damage. It's mainly supposed to be a fun thing
 that's also useful at times when dealing with blocking monsters for example.

 The barrel has enough powder for 10 explosions and does not recharge. It's
 found in Room/lev1_hidden_storage_room. If the player carrying it idles for
 too long it will hop out of his/her/its inventory and start exploring on its
 own.

* birdvial.c

  A vial with a potion a player can drink to be turned into a bird that flies
  away to a location on Newbie Island (Room/bird_tower_top.c). Players can use
  it as a panic button to get out of sticky situations a bit more gracefully.
  It can only be used once and only outdoors. It's found in Room/bird_tower.c

Both of the above are non innable.
