                --== Piratecaves area description ==--
=====================================================================

This area consists of caves and tunnels dug out from under the Newbie
Island troll woods to serve as headquarters and livingquarters for
the Newbie Island pirates. Theres also one huge cave with an
underground lagoon with direct access to the sea, where the pirates
ship is hidden. The ship will have a few rooms in it, and players will
be able to take the ship to sea (see quest documentation). You will
be able to get here through the hidden entrance from the hill in the
Newbie Island troll woods.

Even though the Newbie Island pirates were once the terror of the seas,
they're now little more than a bunch of drunkards. The spoils of thier
plundering have turned them into fat, rich slobs who spend most of
their time drinking instead of robbing the seas. This has depressed
the captain, who can no longer get his crew together to take the ship
to sea.

It is a newbie area where the monsters are all wimpy lvl 2 ones.
