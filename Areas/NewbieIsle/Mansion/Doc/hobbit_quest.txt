                --== The Missing Hobbit quest ==--
=====================================================================

 "A little hobbit girl has lost her friend somewhere in the forest
  east of Hazeldown. Why don't you go there and see if you can
  reunite the two?"

A simple little quest where the player must find the hobbit boy and
lead him back to the hobbit girl. The girl is in the second room of
the path into the area (you can't miss her). She'll sob and if asked
give a little story and tell the player that the task is to find the
hobbit boy and bring him to her.

The hobbit boy is in the cellar of the mansion. He'll tell a little
story himself and ask player to help him. If player does, he'll follow
the player around. He will not enter rooms with goblins so player
must get rid of all goblins on the way back. This can be done by
fighting them or by climbing up into the tower and causing an accident
that kills most of the goblins in the way and leaves those who are not
so they can be fought. The goblin in forest_glen must always be killed
but he's a wimpy lvl 1 monster.

When hobbit boy follows player into the same room as hobbit girl, there
will be a short "quest completed" scene and it's done.

It's a level 3 quest because there's quite a bit of fighting even if
the monsters are wimpy, and that the other way might be a bit tricky
to figure out if you haven't learnt a bit about how areas work here.
