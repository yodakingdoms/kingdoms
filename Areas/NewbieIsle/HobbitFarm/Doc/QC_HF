  QC of HobbitFarm done by Siri 2004-07
==============================================================================

A cute little area. Must be a lot of monsters here for lowlevels to practice
combat skills on.

==============================================================================

Room/
*DONE* The correct word is pitchfork and not hayfork (also seen hay fork
       somewhere), please change those (lots of places).

*DONE* Try to add listen and smell AIs to the rooms.
       YODA: Added 12 listens and 8 smells(!)

*DONE* Don't you think that add_sounds 60 is a bit too long? My
       impression is that you don't hear the sounds that often now.
       YODA: It felt a bit spammy when I was standing around but maybe
             players don't hang around as long as someone making the room
             so I lowered it back to 30

Sometimes the add_items get a bit boring (and sometimes strange as well) if
you just use the same one and puts | inbetween. Like corner and corners, the
desc mentions corners in plural always. It can be a bit boring sometimes.
Change some if you have the time perhaps..
YODA: I do that when there's nothing really special about the item(s) but
      when I don't want 'there is no foo'. It just feels a bit like a waste
      of time to put one item for plural and a different one for singular
      when they all look the same to be honest

dest_room:
Ok.

farm_barn_floor1:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ceiling
*DONE* - typos: do_sit: the first that->than

Ok.

farm_center:
*DONE* - missing AIs: small farm

farm_path1:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ground, farm, stone (from stable)

farm_path2:
*DONE* - missing AIs: tree, net, large field
*DONE* - AI field: perhaps write that there are two fields and not just
          tell about the large one

farm_poultry_yard:
*DONE* - missing AIs: large field, entrance
*DONE* - AI house: a bit weird sentence: since hens probably don't care
          much about how their house looks -> since hens probably don't care
          much about what their house looks like
*DONE* - perhaps add a message when trying to 'enter henhouse' ?

         vegetation (from do_taste)
*DONE* - do_climb: missing return before notify_fail

farm_stable:
*SEE ABOVE* - AI corner: perhaps add a new separate message about just one
              corner, it's a bit boring when looking at one corner gives
              the same message as looking at corners

farm_well:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ground, oak tree, top, top of the hill
*DONE* - typos: AI smell: fill->fills

             YODA: 'many a foot' should be an ok english expression
                   methinks (?)

hazeldown_path2:
*DONE* - missing AIs: top, top of the hill, thorn|s, branch|es, listen
*DONE* - do_relax: perhaps add 'rest'?
*NOT DONE* - also there is no check for argument, you can 'relax blaeh'
             and relax on the log anyway
             YODA: That was intentional, I think it's ok to just 'rest'
                   or 'relax'

hazeldown_path3:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ground, trunk (from tree), bottom (from river)
*DONE* - perhaps add 'drink water'?
*DONE* - typos: Siri stirs in her slumber, and for a second you thought you
         hear a whispering sound coming from the willow treeSuddenly the roots
         of the tree next to where Siriis resting start trembling.
         (thought->think, missing .space after tree and also Siriis -> Siri is,
         missing space)
*DONE* - add_sounds: use present time in all the messages so they are the same,
         thought->think, heard->hear, were->are

house_garden:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ground, apple tree|s,
*DONE* - typos: AI bush: growin->growing
                AI field: weird desc for looking at a field 'there are some
                growing' huh??
*DONE* - do_pick: perhaps add berry and berries as well?

house_hallway:
Ok.

house_hill:
*DONE* - missing AIs: ground, small farm, gate, fence
*DONE* - typos: AI oak: extra space
*DONE* - do_relax: perhaps add 'rest'?
*SEE ABOVE* - also there is no check for argument, you can 'relax blaeh'
              and relax in the grass anyway

house_living_room
*DONE* - missing AIs: ceiling, floor, walls
*DONE* - typos: AI garden: remove \n
         AI south wall: isn't this the desc for the windows? looks
         weird for just a wall..
*DONE* - do_sit: perhaps a message about not being able to sit in a chair
         when trying

house_tree:
*NOT DONE* - add a function for tearing planks loose perhaps?
             YODA: There was going to be a part of the quest up here but I
                   made it simpler in the end. Forgot to change plank item
                   accordingly but that's done now

==============================================================================

Monster/
*DONE(!!!)* set_short should start with lower_case if it's not a name
           (man set_short)


*DONE* Don't you want the monsters to have weapontypes and descs? Like
       hoof for the horses and so on? More fun than just unarmed..

===

crow:
*DONE* - missing id bird

hen:
*DONE* - missing id bird

hobbit_farmer:
*DONE* - do_help: perhaps have if(id(str)) instead so all id's are checked for
*DONE* - greet: perhaps add a check for present player in the room?
*DONE* (!) - great chats *fniffle* ;)

hobbit_wife:
*DONE* - name of her husband is spelled wrong in the set_long

==============================================================================

Object/
