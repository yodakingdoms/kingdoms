The Fish Tales Quest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of the quest is to catch some nice fish, take them to the fisherman,
show them to him and tell some tales about them. The tales have to be good
enough to impress the fisherman. The bigger the fish, the easier it is to
convince him it is true. The whole quest takes place on only a few rooms, like
7 or 8 of them, so it is not very hard (but that's why it is a lowlevel quest)
To solve the quest without knowing anything, one would probably do it this way:

*Find the fisherman: He'll chat something about having lost his fishingpole
                     somewhere on the slope down to the beach. He will also
                     tell the player to bring him three fish and tell fish
                     tales about them. He'll hint about the place where they
                     should go fishing too.

*Find the fishing pole: The fishing pole is found by searching the bush on
                        the slope. It doesn't have to be this fishingpole
                        either, but they can get one here.

*Go fishing: Wade to the stone and start fishing. When they have three fish
             they are satisfied with, go back to the fisherman.

*Tell tales: Tell tales about each fish. When the fisherman has heard enough
             tales that satisfy him, the quest is done, if not, go fishing
             again. Lore skill helps, and the size of the fish is a bonus.
             Can only tell so many tales with one set of fish.

If the player solving it has a lore skill less than 10, he/she/it will get
lore skill raised to 10, thanks to the practice they get in storytelling ;)
