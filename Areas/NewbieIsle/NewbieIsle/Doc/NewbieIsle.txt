A newbiearea where people come with a small rowboat from Lars town.
There will probably be a fee for higher level people to keep them
from this area after they've done it once so that the newbies can
have the monsters for themselves. There will be one low level quest
called Fish Tale quest and a little forest place, where there will
be plenty of foxes, birds, squirrels and that kind of tiny monsters
for the newbies during the day. They will go away when night falls
and the trolls come out from behind their boulder. The trolls will
be really newbiesh as well. The forest area does have a few 'filler'
rooms but thats cause it's mainly supposed do be a place where 
newbies can try out the combat system. No monster here will be higher 
level than level 4.
