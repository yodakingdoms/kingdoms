[990]  5: ~NewbieIsle/o/Room/viewpoint
            - The first room of the troll woods. To get here 
              you have to manage to climb the cliff by shore1
              or figure out the fact that you can stack the
              rocks there for easier climbing.
            - init();
[885]  5: ~NewbieIsle/o/Room/troll_hill
            - The hill in the middle of the troll woods. You need
              to read some items to see you can 'climb hill' to
