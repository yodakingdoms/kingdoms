Special items in this area:
//-Weapons-------------------------------------------------
 fishing_pole   - Talks quite a bit (messages about fishing
                  and so on), but is a crappy blunt with no
                  special attacks. (Used for the fishing 
                  quest

 newbie_weapon  - A random piece of newbie weapon players 
                  below level 5 can get if they toss a coin 
                  into the pond in the troll forest. They are 
                  a little bit better than they should be 
                  considering they are 'poor' but they
                  are only for newbie use, so...
                  Found in room troll_woods7

  twisted_stick - A weapon with a special attack that is really 
                  way to good for an avg weapon, but the special 
                  only happens if the player using it is below
                  level 5, so it should be ok. It can be found in
                  room troll_cave

//-Armour---------------------------------------------------
 newbie_armour  - Same as newbie_weapon

 mithril_sack - A newbie armour that you get from the cave the 
                trolls live in. It is actually too good, but you 
                have to be below lvl 5 to be able to use it. Found
                in room troll_cave
