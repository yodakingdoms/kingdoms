Yoda's Yet-To-Be-Named quest.

To solve the quest the players (P)  have to overthrow Nirach and liberate the'
people of Oakdale. To do this they have to enter the castle, steal the orb, and
destroy it. Killing Nirach will not accomplish this, as his spirit will live on
even if his flesh is slain. Shattering the orb will free Alywin's spirit and 
the Cleric will then bring Nirach with him to the afterlife.

For P the quest starts in the tavern (1) with the storyteller (2). The 
storyteller gives P the background and a few hints; The people who tried to 
do this fifty years ago hung out in the waterfall caves, and a survivor of the
first raid is locked up in the madhouse. P should now know that they have to 
steal and destroy the orb to complete the quest. So, how get the orb and how 
destroy it...

To get the orb: P should first go listen to the mad man(3) in the madhouse. (4)
Among all his rambling chats, he gives P a clue, that they have to hit the 
rock, not just push it. 
 Then P should go to the waterfall caves, where they'll find two things. The 
piece of parchment (5) telling them about the old siege tunnel that can be 
used for entering the castle and the keystone, plus the keystone itself. The 
keystone is hidden behind the rock, which has stuck, and needs to be hit, not 
just pushed (see above).(6,7)
 Then it's off to the stone quarry. When the keystone is placed in the door in
one of the gnome caves(8), the secret tunnel is revealed, and P can sneak into
the deepest dungeon of the castle.(9)They then have to kill the guardian spirit
Nirach has summoned to guard the orb(10), take the orb (11)and then sneak out 
the same way. The spirit is a lev 18 monster, but it's the only thing they will
have to kill if they do it this way. They can, of course, storm in the front
gate of the castle, all guns blazing if they want to, but there will be plenty
of killing before they reach the orb that way.

To destroy the orb: This they'll find out by entering the grove (12)in the 
village and talk to the young piper (13) down by the river. He'll direct them 
to his grandmother who lives in a cottage (14)in the forest. The old woman (15)
will tell them that the orb can be destroyed by placing it upon the altar in 
the shrine north of the village. It is good if they know this when they leave 
the dungeon with the orb. Then they can go straight to the shrine (16)
and place the orb on the altar. The holy power of the altar will shatter the 
orb and free Alywin's spirit, who will do the rest. And that's it. The quest 
is done.*bounce*
