-List of items in the area that needs ARCH approval----------------------------

*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/weapon/dragonstaff.c

 A staff with wc 40 that also talks when it is wielded and while fighting. 
 Wc 40 is very high I know, but the Clwydch sword of light, for example, also
 has wc 40, and that is a longblade with no restrictions at all. This staff is
 a blunt, and you have to be evil to wield it. Furthermore, you need to kill
 the toughest monster in the area to get it.(/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/
 monster/nirach.c if you want to look at it) I've also put lore and runes in
 it, to try to please you enough to let me have it.;>

***
If it doesn't do anything else, except give fancy messages. OK.
***


*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/weapon/dragonbelt.c

 A stat enhancing belt. The belt gives +2 str and +2 int, and takes -2 dex
 and -2 qui. No restrictions. Has lore:). Also comes on the big bad wolf of 
 the area (see above)

***
Could you limit it's use also in soem way - like only mages/ bards or whatever
or perhaps align etc.
***

*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/armour/dragonrobe.c
 
 Badguy's robe. Only special in that while it has 30 ac, 10 db only weighs 1.

***
How many armour locations does it cover? If only one reduce the db.

Yoda: Db reduced to 2.
***

*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/object/spellbook.c

 Spellenhancer with varying multiplier. To even be able to use it, you have to
 be evil, and trying to use it with a nicer align could get you killed. The 
 multiplier varies according to level and align. The maximum is given if you 
 are levl 19 or higher and have an align of -1050 or less. That maximum is 
 17 (*duck*:)). Less level or nicer align gives lower multipliers. Look at the
 code to see how the multiplier works. Not that align doesn't strictly follow
 the demonic/satanic levels, so even if you are satanicm you can't be sure to
 get the full multiplier out of it. I know that 17 is very high, but I would
 really want this to be a special, sought after item for highlevel mages(or
 evil healers!:) That is if there's no drawback that Im not aware of with be
 ing evil as a healer:)). It has lore and runes hinting to it's properties and
 dangers, and belongs to Mr Nirach (see above).

***
No. It is very much like Arsemics tooth that we removed a year and a half ago.
That one was bugging out and this was before we even had inns. So I can say 
with fairly good surety that *17 is way too much whatever the reasons and
restrictions. The *15 that is going out in Ravenloft is an armour that 
covers all locations, has ac 1 db 0 removes all combat abilities and sets 
your hp to max 52. That is where we want a *15 multiplier to be. Arsemics
tooth had a -1100 align requirement and that didn't cut it close enough.

*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/armour/dark_platemail.c

 Armour with ac 35, db 5. Is found on level 14 and higher standard 'henchmen'-
 type monsters. /players/yoda/oakdale/castle/monster/Dcommander.c is the 
 lowest of those who has this armour.
***
AC >35 is supposed to be among the very best armours you can get. To give 
such costly stuff to mere henchmen would be an insult to armoursmiths and
alchemical mages and investors over the world. One or two such armours is
what a very rich lord should be able to afford and supply his best man with
not his standard henchmen.

Yoda:This armour is now found only on the high guards, the cleric, and
Yzwul(see below) A total of 6 monsters in the area has it now.
***
*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/weapon/dark_bastsword.c
 
 Bastardsword (longblade) with wc 32. Found on level 16 henchmen monsters.
 /players/yoda/oakdale/castle/monster/Dhighguard.c more precisely.

***
I guess 32 out of 50 is a little better than 35 out of 40 
Those monsters should be fairly good to get that heavy equip anyway.

Yoda:Same monsters as have the armour above: 4 in the area.
***

*/players/yoda/oakdale/castle/weapon/dark_twohsword.c

 Twohanded sword with wc 38. Found on /players/yoda/oakdale/castle/monster/
                                                                    yzwul.c

***
I hope he is one of a kind and that he is rather tough. :)
Sure, twohanded aren't that common yet.

Yoda:One of a kind, yes.
***

There I think that should be all. If I find anything I have missed, I'll add it
and let you know:)
